# Experiment 1 -  Hello World LED Program Using Blynk App

> A basic Program similar to printing "*Hello World* " in any programming language. The Aim is to controll (On/Off) an LED using **Esp 32** and **Blynk App**

> ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.

## Components Required  
* ESP 32 Development Board 
* USB Cable 
* LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos
* Breadboard 
* Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) X 2 Nos

## Code

```
// Fill-in information from your Blynk Template here
#define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "TMPL72W3EGw5" // This has to be changed using your Template ID.
#define BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME "project1" // This has to be changed using your Device Name.

#define BLYNK_FIRMWARE_VERSION        

#define BLYNK_PRINT Serial
//#define BLYNK_DEBUG

#define APP_DEBUG

// Uncomment your board, or configure a custom board in Settings.h
//#define USE_WROVER_BOARD
//#define USE_TTGO_T7
//#define USE_ESP32C3_DEV_MODULE
//#define USE_ESP32S2_DEV_KIT

#include "BlynkEdgent.h"
BLYNK_WRITE(V0)
{
  int pinValue = param.asInt();
  digitalWrite(15,pinValue); 
}
      
void setup()
{
  pinMode(15,OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(100);

  BlynkEdgent.begin();
}

void loop() {
  BlynkEdgent.run();
}

```

## Procedure

* First connect the LED to ESP32 using breadboard and other components.
* LED positive pin is connected to ESP32 pin no 15.
* LED negative pin is connected to ESP32 GND pin.
* Program the ESP32.  
* Create Templates in BLynk IoT webapp and mobile app. [(Resources)](https://docs.blynk.io/en/t) 
* Connect the ESP32 to wifi network.
* Controll the LED using  BLynk IoT webapp and mobile app.

# Experiment 2 -  LED Control Using Arduino IoT Cloud

> A basic Program similar to printing "*Hello World* " in any programming language. The Aim is to controll (On/Off) an LED using **Esp 32** and **Ardunio IoT Cloud**
> ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.

  delay(1500);

  // Defined in thingProperties.h
  initProperties();

  // Connect to Arduino IoT Cloud
  ArduinoCloud.begin(ArduinoIoTPreferredConnection);

  /*
     The following function allows you to obtain more information
     related to the state of network and IoT Cloud connection and errors

     The default is 0 (only errors).
     Maximum is 4
